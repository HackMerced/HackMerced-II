      Frequently Asked Questions
    </h4>
    <p></p>
    <h5> What is HackMerced? </h5>
    <p>
	  Participants ("hackers") spend a weekend to build a project ("hacks") in teams or individually. There are tons of workshops for beginners to experts, mentors to help you learn, delicious food from local restaurants to fuel you up, and a bunch of energy drinks to power you through. There are sponsors too, so you can mingle with them, find out what they do, or even apply for their job openings.

	  This is where you can bring your ideas to life. If you don’t have any ideas, that’s okay! We have a team-building session at the beginning of the event and a bunch of inspiration from sponsors and category prizes. And if you haven’t made a project yet, this is a great place to start.
    </p>
    <h5> I’m new to hackathons and/or I don’t have experience. Do I have to know how to code to attend? </h5>
    <p>
	  We have a ton of resources! And there are loads of workshops for beginners to experts as well as mentors to help you get started.
    </p>
    <h5 > Is it free? </h5>
    <p>
	  HackMerced is free for all students!
    </p>
    <h5 > Do you provide transportation? </h5>
	   <p>
	  We will provide a charter bus if there are 40 or more students in the area who are attending the event and need a ride. The bus is free, courtesy of HackMerced. The bus is also open to CSULB, Chapman, OCC, and other schools. Tell your friends who are interested in tech and startups to come! Hack Merced is open to students of all majors.

	  If you’re a non-CSUF student in the area, already applied to Hack Merced, and need a ride, email Shelley (phamshelley@csu.fullerton.edu).
    </p>
    <h5 > Will there be swag? </h5>
	  <p>
	  Besides the bunch of awesome swag you will receive from Hack Merced and sponsors, a $10 domain + hosting credit will be given exclusively for CSUF students who attend the event (we only have a limited amount, so it will be distributed on a first come, first serve basis). If we have more codes left, then they will be distributed to other students.
    </p>
    <h5 > How about food? </h5>
	   <p>
	  There will be breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks provided throughout the event. If you have dietary restrictions, we will definitely accommodate!
    </p>
    <h5 > I don’t have a resume. Can I still go? </h5>
	   <p>
	  We know finals is around the corner, so Hack Merced does not require resumes in the application. We’re students too so we totally understand!

	  However, if you are looking for an internship or a job, it’s highly recommended to send in your resume along with your application as we will be sending them to our sponsors. This is super convenient. That way, you don’t have to apply to all of them :)

	  If you need help with your resume, email Marcela (ECS Career Specialist) mrojas@fullerton.edu  to arrange a resume review appointment. She will be available during December 12th-23rd, and after January 3rd until spring semester starts.

	  You can also edit your application once you submit it, so you can upload it or update it before the deadline. If you don’t have one ready by the deadline, that’s okay! You can also hand out your resume during the event.
    </p>
    <h5 > I need help with my resume. Who do I contact? </h5>

        <p>
          <text class='bold'>HackMerced is UC Merced’s second major collegiate hackathon.</text> On
          Feburary 10-12, 2017, the HackMerced Team will invite 500 programmers,
          designers and data scientists from all schools
          and backgrounds to participate in a 36 hour hackathon.
        </p>
        <h6  class='infobox'>HackMerced needs your help</h6>
        <p>
          Hackathons provide a controlled environment for future jobseekers to test out
           their skills and creativity. Participating in a hackathon is a great way to
           connect with programmers, engineers, and designers at their best and worst
           throughout those 36 hours. <text class='bold'>HackMerced as a hackathon provides a unique
           opportunity for organizations to expand their brand to the central valley
           during the midst of the Winter recruiting season.</text>
        </p>
        <p>
          Being a sponsor of HackMerced not only introduces your company to 500 students
           from schools all over the United States, but also provides an environment
           where you can test out new APIs, launch big ideas for hackers to build for you,
           interview potential candidates, as well get an easy tool for searching and
           qualifying recruits for your company.

        <p>
          <text class='bold'>HackMerced virtues transparency</text>
           - we believe that we have a responsibility to notify our
           sponsors on how we use our capital. HackMerced focuses our
           budget on ensuring our hackers have the best time at our event
           by providing them food, snacks, drinks, shelter, tools to hack
           with (hardware, such as power-cords) and shirts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next budgeted item is to bring students from outside Merced
          either through reimbursments to students or hiring buses to connect
          our sister UCs from UC Berkeley, UCLA, UCI, UCSD, UC Davis, UCSC and UCR.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally our last budgeted items include prizes, server hosting and providing hackers
          with hackathon events, such as mini hacks games and midnight milkshakes
          or boba
        </p>
        <h6 class='infobox'>It’s not all about money</h6>

           in return for mentors, food, or hardware for our students to play with.
